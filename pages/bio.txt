![Hi, my name is *[Hubert Si].]
I go by _[hubret] within digital realities.

I study Interaction Design at Sheridan College. This academic year marks my 4th year of study.

I want to shape how technology will fit into humanity's best interests in the future and nurture a culture that uses technology intentionally.

![What I do]
I graduated high school knowing HTML and a bit of CSS, and I had an abstract intuition about what looked good and what didn't when it came to making art.
+
+
My journey since then have caused me to try many things, seek to gain mastery, and even to step out of my comfort zone.
+
+s
I have tried and enjoy a lot of previously foreign things:
=[visual design ++ pure CSS responsive ++ programming ++ teaching ++ photography ++ playing guitar ++ linux ++ slo-pitch softball ++ mathematics ++ vector graphics ++ microanimations ++ music production ++ music theory ++ physical computing ++ electronics ++ typography ++ fontface creation ++ github ++ 3d modelling ++ rendering]
I am not satisfied with how we use technology today and now my personal goal is to make an impact.
