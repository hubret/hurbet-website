This project is comprised of 2 pieces submitted as school assignments.
+
+
The goal was to pick one of 3 contexts between a restaurant, medical service, or transportation service, and then create a website from scratch for their chosen context.
+
+
The first piece included a greybox mockup and a pixel perfect mockup of all views of the website, and the second piece included a greybox prototype and a finished, functional website.
+
+
For me, this was an exercise in storytelling using images (from a Creative Commons image database, which were both used edited and unedited), and an exercise in visual styling and laying out sections of information based on prior planning.
